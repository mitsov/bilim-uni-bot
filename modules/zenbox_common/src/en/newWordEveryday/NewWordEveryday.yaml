  samples:
    - 'Hello! I want to tell you something. Recently I found a box. I opened it, and one bird flew out of it. That was a word. I saw the inscription on the box: "Word of the day." Imagine, every day one word flies out of it. And everyone can get to know it. Do you want to know what word flown out today?'
    - "Here is the word that flew out today. 'To rustle' - so they say when someone makes a quiet sound. For example, dad rustles his newspaper. The leaves rustle underfoot. The beetle rustles its wings. When you go for a walk, listen, who is rustling. Try to rustle a paper."

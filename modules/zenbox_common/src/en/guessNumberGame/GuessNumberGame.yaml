  samples:
    - Guess the number
    - 'Think of a number from one to one hundred. And I will guess it. Say - "greater" if your number is greater than the one I told - or - "less" if your number is less than mine. And do not forget to tell when I guess! So, I say - 1. Is your number greater or less?'
    - Less
    - "No, this can not be! Your number should be less than 101, but more than 0. Let's try again - I say 1. Is your number greater or less?"

  samples:
    - How should we play table tennis?  
    - "A match is played best 3 of 5 games (or 4/7 or 5/9). For each game, the first player to reach 11 points wins that game, however a game must be won by at least a two point margin. A point is scored after each ball is put into play. The edges of the table are part of the legal table surface, but not the sides. Should I continue?"

    - How to use a pawn in chess? 
    - "A pawn moves straight forward. It captures by talking one square diagonally forward. Pawns can never move backwards."

    - I've got an interesting hometask. Will you help me?
    - Sure!
    - Great! A game for you and a test for me! There are so many questions - just say stop when you want to stop. I'll say some numbers. You tell me which is missing - 2, 6, 8, 10
    - It's 4.
    - You are such a wonderful teacher! This is a correct answer! What is 5 minus 3?
    - It's 3.
    - Wrong. But no problem, practice makes perfect! The correct answer is 2. Let's try something easier! What number is missing here? 3, 4, 6, 7

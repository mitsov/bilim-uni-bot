  samples:
    - Let's play the opposites
    - "I will call the word, and you - its opposite. For example, I say 'hot', and you answer - 'cold'. I say 'tall' - and you - 'low'. Let's start?"
    - Ok
    - "I say - 'rich'."
    - Rich
    - "I said rich, and you need to say the opposite."
    - Poor
    - "Right! You're good at it! We continue! I say 'distant'."
    - I want you to guess
    - "Tell me a word. And I will try to guess its opposite."
    - Hot-head
    - "I don't know that yet. Tell me the answer!"
    - Balanced
    - "I will remember that!"

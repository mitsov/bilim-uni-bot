  samples:
    - Let's play cities!
    - Sure! We'll call out the names of cities one after another - each starting with the last letter of the previous city. When you want to stop just say Stop or Enough. And the first city is â€” Alexandria.
    - Astana
    - Ahmedabad
    - Dushanbe
    - Ecatepec
    - Paris
    - Paris starts with P, while Ecatepec ends with C. You have to name a city starting with C. Will you try again?
    - Yes!
    - I'm listening!
    - Celaya
    - Abidjan
    - Stop
    - Let's finish! Our word chain is 6 words long.
